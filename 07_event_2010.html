                                Identity is a central organizing principle of our social lives, yet remains something of an
                                elusive and contested concept throughout the social sciences. Recent research, however, has
                                emphasized the close connections between writing and the construction of an author's identity
                                as we negotiate representations of ourselves through the discourses of our communities. In
                                academic contexts this is often viewed as a repressive and determining system which crushes
                                creativity and privileges certain ways of making meanings, so encouraging the performance of
                                certain kinds of identities. We can, however, see disciplinary conventions as a pattern of
                                options which

                                allows writers to actively accomplish an identity through their discourse choices. In this
                                paper I offer a new way of conceptualizing identity and suggest how corpus methods can be
                                used to inform the idea that identity is performed through language. I do this by exploring
                                the published work of two leading celebrities in applied linguistics: John Swales and Debbie
                                Cameron. By comparing the single authored output of each author with a broader applied
                                linguistics corpus of 750,000 words, I show how their linguistic choices reflect distinctive
                                discoursal identities which mark out their work from the rest of us.

                                This paper aims at analyzing tourism brochures produced by and distributed in the State of
                                Acre, Brazil, in a context of profound political and administrative changes carried out by
                                the Labor Party since the year 1999, by analyzing semiotic resources applied in the creation
                                of meanings. This official propaganda seems to attempt to recast the identity of inhabitants
                                in the State and how they relate to it and to themselves, in a process of identification
                                (Hall, 1996). This study examines texts from a multimodal perspective, considering the
                                different semiotic resources employed in the construction of meanings (Kress and van Leeuwen,
                                2001, 2006) as tools of analysis.
                                Preliminary results indicate that natural resources, indigenous culture at large and certain
                                aspects of history, build the bases for the re-construction of identity, employing different
                                modes and media in a process that ultimately re-writes and re-signifies the very history of
                                the State of Acre.

                                In this presentation, I will talk about some issues in corpus research with reference to a
                                particular usage of abstract nouns which I call signalling nouns. Signalling nouns are nouns
                                which have cohesive properties across and within clauses (Flowerdew, 2003a, 2003b,
                                2006, 2010).<br><br>

                                A signalling noun is potentially any abstract noun the meaning of which can only be made
                                specific by reference to its context. Examples of signalling nouns are attitude, difficulty,
                                fact, process, reason, result, thing etc. The following are examples of signalling nouns
                                functioning in an inter-clausal manner (the first cataphoric and the second anaphoric):
                                <br><br>

                                1. This theory leaves a number of facts unexplained. For exam&shy;ple, starch is absent from
                                the guard cells of certain plants; some guard cells lack chloroplasts but still open and
                                close; and the stomatal movements of some plants may not necessarily be related to the time
                                of day; . . .<br><br>

                                2. Electricity is used to drive the motor of an electric train, but inevitably some of the
                                energy is lost as heat. This unavoidable fact is of great importance in biology.<br><br>

                                While the next example has a signalling noun functioning intra-clausally:<br><br>

                                3. Transpiration is the inevitable result of the necessity for the inside of the leaf to be
                                open to the atmosphere.<br><br>

                                In the presentation, I will first talk about the possible benefits and costs of what I will
                                refer to as a &quot;large small corpus approach&quot; in linguistic research. I will then
                                give a frontstage presentation, showing some corpus results regarding signalling nouns which I
                                am confident about. This will be followed by the presentation of some backstage issues,
                                issues which still need to be resolved. I will seek to engage the audience in a discussion
                                of some of these issues.

                                I will start with the premise that much of what call 'thinking' in the western cultural and
                                scientific tradition is not centralized in individuals. Instead, it is spread across persons,
                                artefacts, texts, environmental affordances, technologies, and cultural norms and constraints.
                                In modern times, this insight has its roots in the earlier work of Vygotsky and Malinowski.
                                Thinking is socially and culturally distributed behaviour that is grounded in the dynamics of
                                human interaction in talk. In this seminar, I will focus exclusively on talk, rather than
                                written text. I take the two be radically different, though this point will not be a focus.
                                My focus will be on the inter-individual patterns of behaviour that are created between
                                persons when they interact in talk. Talk is behaviour that involves diverse agents and a
                                diversity of bodily resources that are dialogically coordinated in local and nonlocal ways.
                                Agents and their bodies are what I will call a first-order interactional resource for
                                achieving socially distributed ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. I will use multimodal
                                interaction analysis to explore aspects of this, though the emphasis will be on whole-body
                                meaning-making, rather than on separate 'modalities' that are combined. We will consider how
                                these resources function to coordinate the actions, perspectives, feelings, and
                                representations of social agents.<br><br>

                                Agents-in-interaction coordinate their value-realizing and meaning-seeking activities in
                                familial, institutional and other settings. They do so in relation to personal and
                                institutional projects and the social and cultural norms to which they orient. In doing so,
                                they both extend the human ecology and orient to and coordinate their joint activities with
                                the larger institutional frame and its knowledge economy. I will also consider the normative,
                                second-order character of cultural patterns and constraints. This is where lexicogrammar and
                                discourse patterns come in. With these considerations suitably harnessed, I will offer some
                                reflections on the ways in which talk extends human agency and the human ecology in
                                situation-transcending ways.<br><br>

                                I will consider above all how, through first-order interactional resources, agents-in-interaction
                                coordinate brain, bodies, events, and technologies in order to make things happen in particular
                                settings. The notion of 'first-order interaction' does not refer to lexicogrammatical patterns and
                                discourse structures. I see the latter as a further layer of cultural patterns and constraints
                                deriving from longer, slower cultural-community time-scales. I take these to be second-order
                                cultural patterns. First-order interaction just is dialogically coordinated body dynamics and
                                behaviour between agents-in-interaction. It includes, for example, the very rapid pico-scale
                                of the dynamical bodily events (e.g. vocalizations, eye gaze, gesture, body postures and
                                movements) on very short time-scale of fractions of seconds to milliseconds. Such events
                                play a central role in coordinating agents, their actions, perceptions, feelings, understandings,
                                relevant technologies and environmental artefacts and affordances in real-time. First-order interaction
                                is itself directly meaningful. It is not like a constructed code. Instead, it is living, feeling,
                                moving persons acting in their worlds. I will put the emphasis on first-order interaction,
                                which is always multimodal, as a form of agent- and world-extending activity linking diverse
                                time-scales (e.g. neural, bodily, situational, cultural). In so doing, agents give rise to the
                                forms of collective cognition, perception, and action that extend both their agency and their
                                Umwelten.<br><br>

                                In my presentation, I will consider how many aspects of so-called 'higher' cognitive processes
                                are constructed in and through inter-individual patterns of multi-agent and embodied multimodal
                                interaction in the real-time dynamics of talk. Some relevant questions to be considered are:
                                What is the role of embodied multimodal meaning-making in the creation of external
                                representations that guide activity and awareness in various tasks and social practices?
                                How do these resources function to select, connect and focus on cognitively salient aspects
                                of the environment? How do interpersonally/dialogically coordinated patterns of bodily
                                activity enable agents to lock into environmental tasks, organise them, segment them into
                                separate components, link their different parts into larger wholes, conceptualise them, and
                                enable complex computational tasks to be handled as socially distributed and embodied ones
                                (instead of individually centralized, internal and abstract mental ones)? How is the external
                                world harnessed and coordinated in productive ways in and through inter-individual activity
                                with full-body sense-making and perception in order to solve cognitive and computational tasks
                                and problems. What are the implications for a theory of learning?<br><br>

                                I will use video recordings to illustrate my arguments. Examples will include infant-parent
                                interaction, a learning task involving primary age children, and a domestic situation.

                                The Reading to Learn (hereafter R2L) is a literacy program developed by Rose (2004a, b, 2005,
                                2006) for the purpose of enabling all learners to read and write successfully. It is grounded
                                on the theoretical model of language developed by Michael Halliday (1994) and a theory of
                                genre developed by Martin (Martin 1993, 2000; Rothery 1994). Like the Teaching and Learning
                                Cycle designed by Rothery (1994) and her colleagues, R2L consists of three stages with each
                                divided into two phases. It begins with the Deconstruction stage of Preparing before Reading
                                and Detailed Reading. Then at the Joint Construction stage, the teacher and students proceed
                                to Sentence or Note Making and Joint Rewriting. The last stage is Independent Construction
                                which covers the phases of Individual Rewriting and Independent Writing. In terms of
                                pedagogical orientations, the innovative approach is characterized by its adoption of an
                                explicit mode of transmission and its ideologically motivated advocacy to empower the
                                disadvantaged groups in Australia.<br><br>

                                R2L is currently being incorporated into a writing
                                course entitled Intensive Academic Writing (IAW) at a center for English teaching in an
                                Australian university. This is a pre-sessional five week course mostly for Chinese students
                                preparing to enter a post-graduate program in the university. This presentation will focus on
                                the analysis of teacher's talk around the text in the Deconstruction stage. It draws on
                                instantiation theory from Systemic Functional Linguistics (Martin 2008, 2010), exploring
                                relations between teacher's elaboration and academic discourse. How are features of academic
                                discourse elaborated? How does meaning shift from an academic text to teacher's elaboration
                                on it? In what ways are commitment resources deployed to scaffold accademic readings? I will
                                identify major patterns of commitment relations in the teacher's talk around the text and
                                discuss their functions in the scaffolding process. I will also examine teacher's pedagogical
                                treatment of grammatical metaphor and technical terms The analysis is based on two
                                demonstration lessons given by David Rose (2003) and six audio-taped classroom lessons
                                given by three centre teachers using the approach. <br><br>

                                Currently in the academy trans- or inter-disciplinary studies are actively encouraged, yet
                                the implications for the discourses of research are as yet poorly understood. An appreciation
                                of the ways in which different disciplines use language differently to mean differently is
                                fundamental to understanding the potential for effective collaboration, and to providing
                                meaningful support to those who study, research or provide language support across
                                disciplinary boundaries. In this paper my exploration of disciplinary difference focuses on
                                one key text type - that of the introductions to research articles.<br><br>

                                Introductory sections of research articles across disciplines in the sciences, social
                                sciences and humanities share a common generalised social purpose, that is, to construct a
                                legitimising platform from which the writer can proceed to report in detail on their study
                                and the contribution they make to knowledge. They function as a warrant for the writer's
                                study (Hood 2010). Within the common generalised function of a research warrant, variations
                                may reflect differences in the nature of the object of study and/or the writer's
                                interpretation of how best to position their own research, but variations also arise in
                                response to disciplinary differences. <br><br>

                                In taking a closer look at how the disciplinary
                                context can impact on the construction of the research warrant I draw on two bodies of theory.
                                From the sociology of knowledge I connect with theorisations of how different intellectual
                                fields or disciplines represent different kinds of knowledge structure (Bernstein 1996, 1999,
                                2000), or as Maton (2007) articulates different knowledge-knower structures, with different
                                codes for legitimating both what can be known and how - epistemic relations - and who can
                                know it - social relations (Maton 2000a, 2000b, 2007). This theorisation of how different
                                kinds of intellectual fields legitimate themselves in different ways would seem to have
                                particular relevance to an analysis of how researchers construct a warrant for their own
                                research, and how they might do so differently in different disciplines. <br><br>

                                From Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) I draw on appraisal theory as a basis for exploring
                                aspects of evaluation in the discourse. Of particular relevance here is the dimension of
                                appraisal theory referred to as engagement (Martin &amp; White 2005). Engagement theorises
                                options for introducing and managing multiple voices in discourse, theorising options for
                                aligning or dis-aligning the reader with the contributions from those voices. Implicated in
                                the construction of heteroglossic (multi-voiced) discourse are linguistic resources of
                                projection, modality and negation, and counter-expectancy (Martin &amp; Rose 2007).<br><br>

                                In this paper I focus in particular on instances of projection, analysing how much and what
                                kind of information is provided about other voices and why, and what it is that those voices
                                are introduced to contribute and appraise. From the dual theoretical bases of Bernsteinian
                                sociology of knowledge and SFL I proceed to explore how an analysis of the ways in which
                                research writers engage with other voices in their introductions can provide insights into
                                how disciplines differ in their strategies for legitimising the construction of new knowledge.

                                This talk is based on research into the effect of bilingual education on students' first
                                language written discourse. The research set out to compare the written Spanish of secondary
                                students on a bilingual (English Medium of Instruction, or EMI) programme with the Spanish of
                                their counterparts studying the traditional Spanish-medium curriculum, and found differences
                                between the two groups of students, including in use of clause complexes, interpersonal and
                                textual Theme, thematic progression, and text structure. The talk will discuss these
                                differences, and will also consider methodological difficulties with contrastive work,
                                using examples from Spanish and English but addressing questions that should be relevant to
                                those working with other languages, for example Chinese. Cross-linguistic textual comparison
                                has long been found to be problematic: I will discuss some of the major difficulties
                                encountered by those outside SFL, focusing on those loosely working under the term
                                Contrastive Rhetoric (CR), and also look at issues within SFL for working across languages,
                                particularly the analysis of Theme.

                                Starting from September 2010, over 300 former CMI (Chinese Medium Instruction) secondary
                                schools in Hong Kong are allowed to switch the medium of instruction (MOI) to English for
                                some of their academic subjects or for some percentage of the lesson time of each of their
                                academic subjects under the new 'fine-tuning MOI policy' of the Hong Kong Education Bureau.
                                Many CMI schools have chosen to change the MOI of one or two of their academic subjects
                                (usually Science or Mathematics, but in some schools Geography or Economics too) or some
                                percentage of the lessons of each of their academic subjects from CMI to EMI (English Medium

                                pressing question, however, remains: what kind of bridging curriculum and pedagogy will help
                                (former CMI) students to cope with changing their learning medium to English?<br><br>

                                In this presentation, I draw on three theoretical traditions in applied/educational
                                linguistics and propose a blueprint for designing and developing a viable genre-based
                                bridging curriculum for Hong Kong secondary schools to assist students in making the
                                transition from CMI to EMI academic learning. The three theoretical frameworks drawn upon are:

                                Systemic Functional Linguistics has always stressed the dialectic interaction between theory
                                and practice. Halliday's vision is to construct an appliable theory that can be helpful to
                                people who are engaging with language in their work. This paper intends to review Halliday's
                                explorations into the complementarities in language, including those between lexis and
                                grammar, &quot;language as system&quot; and &quot;language as text&quot;, and the two modes
                                of speaking and writing, and to discuss the implications for an appliable linguistics. It
                                is pointed out that the emphasis of Systemic Functional Linguistics on social accountability
                                stems from its nature as a politicized theory, a kind of

                                This seminar aims at illustrating the enabling power of Systemic Functional Linguistics in
                                relating linguistic features and contextual features in interpersonal communication to study
                                interpersonal distance through the theoretical construction of the concept 'socio-semiotic
                                distance'. Proposed in Lam (2010), socio-semiotic distance refers to individual's degree of
                                familiarity and his/her polarity of affect to the other resulting from their co-engagement
                                in meaning-making processes. This concept is related to the established concept 'social
                                distance' in sociology (Bogardus, 1959) in the way that these two concepts belong to the
                                fourth order semiotic system and the third order social system respectively (Matthiessen,
                                Teruya &amp; Lam, 2010:152, on 'ordered typology of systems'). As a concept referring to
                                certain aspects of interpersonal relationship, socio-semiotic distance can be ¡§located¡¨
                                at the contextual stratum in the 'architecture of language' (Halliday, 2003).<br><br>

                                One of the many challenges in constructing the concept is to develop a methodology for its
                                measurement. As preliminarily demonstrated in Lam &amp; Webster (2009), Systemic Functional
                                Linguistics provides means to relate lexicogrammatical features of texts produced in
                                interpersonal communication and the contextual features 'affect' (referred as 'orientation'
                                in Lam &amp; Webster, 2009), thus forming the basis of a methodology to objectively measure
                                socio-semiotic distance by analyzing the linguistic features exhibited in interpersonal
                                communication.<br><br>

                                This seminar discusses the technical issues encountered in the development of such
                                methodology of measuring socio-semiotic distance, reflecting how the theoretical framework
                                of Systemic Functional Linguistics enables the correlating of text (in terms of
                                lexicogrammatical features) and context of situation. Furthermore, this seminar attempts
                                to illustrate that, by taking more lexicogrammatical features of interpersonal communication
                                into account, measuring socio-semiotic distance can also be appliable on the study of
                                interpersonal relationships vis-&agrave;-vis linguistic behaviours of the individuals
                                involved.<br><br>

                                Conceptual metaphor theory has dominated linguistic studies of lexical metaphor since the
                                1980s, emphasizing ideational meanings to the neglect of the textual and interpersonal.
                                Though much has been written within this tradition of the conceptualization of emotion or
                                affect, comparatively little work has focused on the use of metaphors for the expression of
                                affect for evaluative purposes or appraisal. While acknowledging that description and
                                expression of affect may overlap in some cases (e.g. 1st person statements) this talk hopes
                                to start to restore the balance by demonstrating the importance of metaphor¡¦s expressive
                                function.<br>

                                The neglect of affective metaphorical expressions is partly simply a reflection of the
                                neglect of the interpersonal semantics in many mainstream linguistic theories. One exception
                                is Systemic Functional Linguistics, where the interpersonal (meta)function of language has
                                always received attention, especially, recently, in Appraisal Theory. Though this theory and
                                SFL have not explored the semantics of lexical metaphors, nevertheless, a large proportion of
                                the lexis listed by Martin and White (2005) for, for example, Appreciation consists of
                                conventional metaphors. Swearing, too, more

                                conventional English metaphors (Metalude) may be mined to reveal the extent of metaphor¡¦s
                                expressive/appraising usage. It explores four questions. <br><br>
                                (1) Is there a transfer of evaluation, and if so is it from the vehicle to the topic or from
                                the topic to the vehicle?

                                (2) In the latter case, does this evaluative transfer depend upon the participation of the
                                metaphor theme in some larger schema? <br><br>
                                (3) What role does multivalency (same vehicle for different topics) play in reinforcing

                                <br><br>
                                The talk concludes by discussing whether metaphor is essentially more evaluative
                                than conceptual.

                                This presentation considers the discourse of modern history in Australian secondary schools
                                from the perspective of systemic functional linguistics and social realism. In particular it
                                develops work on genre and field in history discourse in relation to knowledge structure, and
                                the role of technical concepts realised as -isms. These are interpreted in relation to recent
                                work on the axiological charging of terms, especially in humanities and social science
                                discourse, so that how you feel turns out to be as important as what you know as far as an
                                historian's gaze on the past is concerned. This cosmological perspective is illustrated from
                                textbooks and classroom
