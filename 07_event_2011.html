    content="The Halliday Centre is motivated by Michael Halliday’s insight into language as a social phenomenon that creates meaning and enables communication. It aims to advance human knowledge about language and to apply such knowledge to emergent technologies such as artificial intelligence where language understanding represents a key issue. – Alex Fang, Centre Director" />

                                    In this seminar, I will present a platform for annotating multilayered functional
                                    structure and
                                    discourse
                                    structure with a collaborative interface built on a cloud-based infrastructure. The
                                    purpose of the
                                    research is to provide a visually structured, interactive annotation framework for
                                    exploring the
                                    semantics,
                                    function and discourse structure of language data otherwise invisible or difficult
                                    to access.
                                    Through the innovative visualization/annotation platform, we introduce a number of
                                    contributions
                                    to the study and analysis of language. Our platform introduces immediate,
                                    interactive visualization
                                    of metafunctions, allowing users to explore and manipulate multi-layered semantic
                                    and functional
                                    information more effectively. The platform visualizes the complex interrelations of
                                    discourse
                                    structures
                                    at various levels, a process expected to help researchers keep track of structural
                                    development and
                                    explore how different components relate to make meaning.<br><br>
                                    We demonstrate that a collaborative cloud-based annotation platform can facilitate
                                    cooperation
                                    and Computer Assisted Language Learning. Linguistic data are stored in a cloud-based
                                    platform for
                                    universal retrieval, exchange and collaboration. Researchers simultaneously work on
                                    the same
                                    text/corpus, collaborating on a designated visualization/annotation task. Linguistic
                                    experts can thus
                                    provide grammar and discourse illustrations to language learners and assess
                                    students' understanding of
                                    the text.<br><br>
                                    Although developed with SFL in mind, the generic object-oriented database
                                    architecture and
                                    data processing model on which the platform is built provide convenient interfacing
                                    to other
                                    visualization
                                    models. Initial experiments find very promising results with Rhetorical Structure

                                    In linguistics, prosody generally refers to the rhythm, stress and intonation of the
                                    speech that are
                                    suprasegmental features that operate over long stretches of the utterance. In

                                    linguistics, the term prosody has been extended to grammar and semantics to refer to

                                    Halliday (1979) suggests
                                    that experiential meaning is associated with particulate structure, interpersonal
                                    meaning with
                                    prosodic structure, and textual meaning with periodic structure. Interpersonal
                                    meanings are the
                                    speaker's ongoing interference in the speech event. This ongoing distribution of
                                    interpersonal
                                    meanings throughout the clause and segments of discourse is prosody-like. The effect
                                    is non-discrete
                                    and then cumulative. Martin (1995, 1996) takes the further step of elaborating on
                                    manifestations of
                                    prosodic structure at the clause and text level. Martin (2004) notes that prosody is
                                    manifested in the
                                    systems of modality, polarity, attitude, mood, and honorification, and an array of
                                    strategies can be
                                    deployed to construct prosodic realization. <br><br>
                                    Modality is a major semantic resource construing the interpersonal meaning of
                                    language. Its typical
                                    realization in Chinese clauses is in a prosodic fashion. Modal auxiliaries can occur
                                    at the beginning
                                    of the clause complex as thematized comment, dominating meanings expressed in the
                                    dependent clause.
                                    They can also be used successively in the clause to amplify the modal meaning.
                                    Modals can even appear
                                    at the end of the clause as information focus, enabling a prosodic flow of the modal
                                    meaning
                                    retrospectively from the New to the rest of the clause.<br><br>

                                    Systemic Functional Linguistics (hereafter SFL) boasts a long tradition in its
                                    fruitful
                                    interdisciplinary dialogue with Bernstein's sociology of education. Martin (2011)
                                    outlines four phases
                                    of interaction between SFL and Berstein's theory. The first revolves around the
                                    theme of semantic
                                    variation, providing linguistic evidence for coding orientation. The second phase is
                                    concerned with
                                    the development of the Sydney School genre-based literacy using Bernstein's theory
                                    of pedagogic
                                    discourse. The third shifts to a focus on understanding knowledge structures through
                                    field analysis.
                                    The fourth comes back to concerns with users of language, examining the issues of
                                    identity and
                                    community. Drawing on the second and third phases of the interdisciplinary dialogue,
                                    this presentation
                                    discusses Bernsteinian influence on the development of the Reading to Learn program,
                                    a Sydney School
                                    approach to genre pedagogy. It reviews research on the use of Bernstein's theory to
                                    support the
                                    development of the program and examines issues related to attributes of horizontal
                                    and vertical
                                    discourses and the bridging of the two discourses in the Reading to Learn classroom
                                    practice.

                                    Verbal group of most languages, if not all, is potentially the most important
                                    element in the
                                    environment of clause, as it is packed with different layers of meaning. Bajjika, an

                                    language spoken in the northern province of Bihar in India, is no different in this
                                    respect; rather
                                    Bajjika is even more prominent than many other (Indo-Aryan) languages in that it
                                    uses the verbal group
                                    as the most radiant category to express a number of experiential and interpersonal
                                    features. For

                                    than identifying the Subject: the "multiple" agreement marking in Bajjika is
                                    anchored in the "social

                                    National vertebration is widely recognized as one of the key problems Spain has had
                                    for over one
                                    hundred years. The country's profound decentralization in recent years has by no
                                    means toned down the
                                    identity debate in Spanish society (Moreno, 2001). On the contrary, Linz's
                                    description of Spain as "an
                                    State for all Spaniards, a Nation-State for a large part of the population and only
                                    an State but not a
                                    nation for important minorities" continues to apply today (Linz, 1979). This paper
                                    analyzes the
                                    competing narratives of El País and El Mundo, Spain most popular newspapers, over a
                                    period of twelve
                                    years (1996-2007). A comparison will be made on how the concept of nation is
                                    discursively constructed
                                    in a corpus of 36,145 news articles totalling over 20 million tokens. While
                                    illustrating the great
                                    potential offered by corpus-based discourse studies in social research, conclusions
                                    are also drawn on
                                    the lack of consensus on national vertebration in Spanish society and on the
                                    problematic nature of
                                    objectivity in news-making.<br><br>

                                    academic settings, which
                                    serve as a gateway to discourses of power. Drawing on a systemic-functional
                                    understanding of language,
                                    the presentation will then examine texts written by users of World Englishes and
                                    demonstrate how texts
                                    valued in academic disciplines make use of comparable linguistic resources
                                    regardless of the
                                    national/linguistic origin of the authors. Equipped with this linguistic analysis of
                                    texts written by
                                    students from Outer circle countries, the paper will discuss some pedagogical
                                    practices (and
                                    educational material) adopted in teaching English as a second/foreign language and
                                    investigate hidden
                                    agendas that arguably limit the potential social and economical mobility of many of
                                    the learners
                                    (rather than enhancing it).<br><br>

                                    and the Cardiff Models of language (the result of Halliday's five great insights of
                                    the 1960s/70s),
                                    while also pointing out some of the main developments in the Cardiff Model that have
                                    been steadily
                                    being introduced since the 1970s. In the final phase of the lecture we shall,
                                    together, demonstrate a
                                    'microgrammar' version of the full Cardiff Grammar - with you making the choices in
                                    the system network
                                    - as we see (i) how the components of a SFG work together to generate
                                    text-sentences, and (ii) how
                                    certain important developments from the COMMUNAL Project in the use of probabilities
                                    help us to
                                    generate 'better' text-sentences.

                                    Director of the
                                    Computational Linguistics Unit in the Centre for Language and Communication, Cardiff
                                    University. His
                                    research interests embrace linguistic theory, systemic functional linguistics in a
                                    cognitive-interactive framework, the computer modelling of language in both
                                    generation and
                                    understanding, and the description of English and other languages for these two
                                    purposes and for the
                                    analysis of texts. His work with his colleagues (Tucker, Lin, Tench, Young, Huang,
                                    Neale, Castel and
                                    others, including his many research students) builds on developments in linguistics
                                    of the 1990s, and
                                    it has led to the emergence of what is now recognized as an alternative version of
                                    SFL to that of
                                    Halliday: the 'Cardiff Grammar' (Butler 2003). 2008 was a landmark, in that it saw
                                    the publication of
                                    his Invitation to Systemic Functional Linguistics in English, Chinese and Spanish.
                                    Altogether, he has
                                    published ten books, over sixty papers in journals or as book chapters, and around
                                    seventy research
                                    reports, reviews and interviews. He is currently working on three major books. He is
                                    a frequent
                                    speaker and lecturer at overseas conferences and universities, having lectured in 26
                                    different
                                    counties. He is on the Editorial Board of the journal Functions of Language; he is a
                                    series editor for
                                    Equinox; and he holds guest professorships in three universities in China, where he
                                    is a particularly
                                    frequent visitor.
