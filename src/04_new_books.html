								<p>Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday (1925-2018) was an iconic figure
									in the field of linguistics and the pioneer responsible for the development
									of systemic functional linguistics (SFL). The impact of his work extends
									beyond linguistics, into the study of stylistics, computation linguistics,
									visual narrative and multimodal communication and he was a founder of the
									field of social semiotics. Written by leading figures in the field,
									The Bloomsbury Companion to M. A. K. Halliday provides readers with an
									authoritative overview of Halliday's early career, his most important
									theoretical findings and how his work influenced the development of linguistics
									as a discipline. This paperback edition features a new chapter exploring his
									theory of verbal art and verbal science and the metaphor-making potential available
									in language, the final contribution to the field of one of the world's leading
									and most influential linguists.</p><br><br>

								<p>How does one’s grammar depend on one’s conception of language?
									In systemic functional linguistics, language is viewed as a meaning potential,
									thus embracing the view, now supported by contemporary theories of the evolution
									of human consciousness, that language has evolved in the living of life in society.
									Using the theoretical framework of systemic functional linguistics, the chapters of
									this book explore the nature of language, the relations of meaning and society, of
									form and meaning, and of grammar and lexis. Halliday has referred to the level of
									lexicogrammar as the powerhouse of language: this is where the resource for creating
									linguistic meaning resides. But language as resource cannot be adequately described
									as a set of syntagmatic structures; instead, the primary focus must be on the
									paradigmatic axis, which after all furnishes the principle for the actualisation
									of syntagms. Accordingly, aspects of Urdu and English semantics, grammar and
									lexis are presented here in terms of systemic options, realised as structures.</p><br><br>

								The concept <i>context of situation</i> introduced by Malinowski some eighty years ago
								has now become an essential element of the vocabulary of any linguistic theory whose
								aim is to reveal the nature of language. With the abandonment of the spurious distinction
								between competence and performance, the process of language, i.e., language use, has claimed its
								rightful
								place in the study of language. The chapters of this book focus on the relations of context and text,
								conceptualising the latter as language operative in some recognizable social context.
								It is argued that context is not simply a backdrop for the occurrence of words; rather,
								it is an active element which on the one hand plays a crucial role in the progression of
								human discourse and on the other enters into and shapes the very nature of language as process
								and as system, furnishing the foundation for functionality in language. Acting as the interface
								between language and society, context analysis reveals the power of language for creating,
								maintaining and changing human relationships.<br><br>

								This book is based on a series of lectures, which begin with a look at the history of the language
								that we use in order to encode our knowledge, particularly our scientific knowledge,
								i.e., the history of scientific English. Prof. M.A.K. Halliday poses the question of how a growing child
								comes
								to master this kind of language and put it to his or her own use as a means of learning.
								In subsequent chapters, Halliday explores the relationship between language, education and culture,
								again taking the language of science as the focal point for the discussion; and finally he draws these
								various
								themes together to construct a linguistic interpretation of how we learn and how we learn how to
								learn.<br><br>

								The Bloomsbury Companion to M. A. K. Halliday is a comprehensive and accessible reference resource
								to one of the world's leading and most influential linguists.<br><br>

								Born in 1925, Halliday is the figure most responsible for the development of systemic functional
								linguistics (SFL). The impact of his work extends beyond linguistics, into the study of visual and
								multimodal communication. He is considered the founder of the field of social semiotics. Written by
								leading figures in the field, the volume provides readers with an authoritative overview of his
								early career, his most important theoretical findings and how his work has influenced linguistics
								as a discipline. From the publishers of his 'Collected Works' and 'The Essential Halliday', this is
								another must have book underlining Halliday's impact on the field of linguistics.<br><br>

								Whether prose or poetry, how does a text come to mean what it does? A
								functional-semantic approach to text analysis, such as is illustrated
								in this book, offers a revealing look at the resources of language at
								work in the creation of meaning, and a unique perspective on the text
								as object of study. Believing the best way to learn about text linguistics
								is through the analysis of full texts, the authors include analyses of texts,
								both spoken and written, drawn from a variety of genres, including examples
								of religious and political discourse. In the first section, the authors
								provide an overview suitable to those who are new to the theory and methodology
								of Systemic Functional Grammar and Rhetorical Structure Theory.
								Building on this foundation, section two presents the findings from several
								case studies in text analysis, demonstrating how to conduct indepth functional-semantic
								analysis of selected texts. This second section will benefit both beginners and those
								who have already had some background in the study of linguistics. Text Linguistics is
								the ideal choice for those who are learning about text linguistics, and functional
								approaches to language study.<br>

								This book applies linguistic analysis to the poetry of Emeritus Professor Edwin Thumboo, a
								Singaporean poet and leading figure in Commonwealth literature. The work explores how
								the poet combines grammar and metaphor to make meaning, making the reader aware of
								the linguistic resources developed by Thumboo as the basis for his unique technique.
								The author approaches the poems from a functional linguistic perspective, investigating
								the multiple layers of meaning and metaphor which go into producing these highly
								textured, grammatically intricate works of verbal art. The approach is based on Systematic
								Functional Theory, which assists with investigating how the poet uses language
								(grammar) to craft his text, in a playful way that reflects a love of the language. The
								multilingual and multicultural experiences of the poet are seen to have contributed to his
								uniquely creative use of language.
								This work demonstrates how Systematic Functional Theory, with its emphasis on
								exploring the semogenic (meaning-making) power of language, provides the handle we
								need to better understand poetic works as intentional acts of meaning.
								The verbal art of Edwin Thumboo illustrate Barthes' point that "Bits of code, formulae,
								rhythmic models, fragments of social languages, etc. pass into the text and are
								redistributed within it, for there is always language before and around the text."
								With a focus on meaning, this functional analysis of poetry offers an insightful look
								at the linguistic basis of Edwin Thumboo's poetic technique. The work will appeal to
								scholars with an interest in linguistic analysis and poetry from the Commonwealth and
								new literatures, and it is also well suited to support courses on literary stylistics or text
								linguistics.<br>
