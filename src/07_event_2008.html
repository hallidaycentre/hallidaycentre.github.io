								This seminar aims to survey the plurality of computer-mediated communication with respect to
								three Southeast Asian varieties of English, and touch on what this type of linguistic evidence
								means for the practice of corpus and Hallidayan linguistics.<br><br>Computer-mediated
								communication - a rubric term for &quot;Netlingo&quot;, &quot;Textese&quot;,
								&quot;Netspeak&quot;, and &quot;Weblish&quot; - is increasingly under scrutiny by educators
								and linguists alike. This view is complicated by the fact that there is not just one
								'universal' type of electronic communication in English. In Southeast Asia alone, there is
								a whole range of computer-mediated discourses in Singaporean, Malaysian, and Filipino
								Englishes - notably in instant messaging, text messaging, online chatrooms and personal
								blogs.<br><br>

								As the younger generation increasingly goes online 24/7, such types of linguistic evidence
								have to be factored into linguistic theory, corpus building, dictionary-making, software
								compilation, and educational discourse.

								<b>Part 1: What do writers evaluateand how?</b><br><br>

								<img src="events/2008/2008_11_03-05_JamesMartin_SusanHood/pic_groupphoto.JPG" alt="" width="180"
									height="135" style="float:right; padding:10px">
								In the first half of this seminar I explore the ways in which published academic writers
								legitimise their research in the introductions to their research articles (RAs). The data I
								will draw on are from published RAs in the fields of education and applied linguistics. My
								theoretical tool is Systemic Functional Linguistic theory, most particularly theories of
								meaning making at the level of discourse semantics, with specific reference to with reference
								to Appraisal theory (Martin &amp; White 2005). The analyses reveal a differentiation of two
								key fields in the discourse, one to do with the actual object of study, the other to do with
								the processes of knowledge building around this object of study. Typically each field is
								evaluated using different evaluative strategies.<br><br>

								<b>Part 2: Ways of creating spacefor new knowledge: The role ofGraduation</b><br><br>
								In the second part of the seminar I focus in on one key resource for evaluating that was
								encountered in Part 1, namely that of Graduation (Hood &amp; Martin 2007) to consider how
								and why Graduation functions as a key resource in evaluation in academic writing. The analyses
								reveal that by grading experiential meanings writers are able to imply a stance while avoiding
								potentially divisive dichotomised positive or negative evaluations, and by blurring categorical
								boundaries they are able to create space for new knowledge.<br><br>

								Finally we can return to the title and reflect on how it is that academic writers in English
								manage the apparently contradictory expectations that they be both persuasive and 'objective'
								in creating a space for new knowledge. And most importantly consider the context of pedagogy,
								and how we can make the demands of academic writing more transparent to novice writers of
								academic English.<br><br>

								<b>Part 1: Summary writing in academic contexts: Implicating meaning in processes of change</b>
								<br><br>

								Being able to summarise source texts is an important component in writing multi-voiced texts
								as essays, literature reviews, research proposals and reports. Typically students are expected
								to demonstrate an understanding of the key meanings encoded in source texts by recording those
								meanings in note form, and then reconstructing them as a shorter summary text relying minimally
								on the original wording. What may appear a relatively straightforward process is made
								considerably more complex when we consider that any change in wording necessarily impacts on
								meaning in some way. So what is involved in the task of satisfactorily re-presenting meanings
								from one source as new wordings in a second text? To explore this question I draw on Systemic
								Linguistic theory to analyse one pedagogic model of summary writing. My aims are two-fold: to
								explore how meaning is implicated in changing wordings; and to consider at a theoretical level
								what is involved in these changes. It is hoped in this way to develop a framework that can
								help academic language educators to better understand and articulate what summarising,
								reviewing, and re-drafting involve in terms of changing meanings, and to better scaffold
								this process for students and novice writers in academic English.<br><br>

								<b>Part 2: The embodied practice of teaching: Analysing gesture in teacher talk</b><br><br>

								This paper draws on a study of gesture in teacher talk in face-to-face classrooms. The study
								proceeds from a social semiotic perspective that approaches gesture as a meaning potential.
								The study questions how meanings are realised in bodily movements and how those bodily
								movements relate to speech and interact with other visual semiotics. The analyses explore
								the potential for metafunctional meanings to be realised in gestures, resulting in the
								construction of tentative and partial system networks of meaning choices. Gestures and
								speech can be seen to cooperate as co-expressive and as complementary ways of meaning. The
								study contributes to a growing body of work in social semiotics that enables us to better
								understand practice as multimodal meaning making.

								This presentation opens with a discussion suggesting that a consensus has been growing among
								genre theorists and scholars since Hyon's 1996 article outlined &quot;three traditions&quot;.
								Professor Swales then raises the issue of defining genre itself and goes on to propose that a
								metaphorical approach is a viable alternative. Two extensive illustrations follow. The first
								deals with the US PhD dissertation defense, drawing on Grimshaw (1989) and three transcripts
								from the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English. Is this &quot;a meaningless ritual&quot;
								or a true test? The second explores the art history monograph. Among other facets, Professor
								Swales suggests, despite appearances to the contrary, that a book-length study describing an
								artist's life and work is no longer the &quot;top genre&quot; in the fine art field.
