					<h1>Automatic Nominalization and Lexical Formality Application for Academic Writing</h1>
					<p>
						Automatic paraphrasing has received much interest in the computational linguistics community in recent
						years. One type of paraphrasing is lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009), which replaces a word
						or short phrase with another. Paraphrasing can also involve manipulation of the clausal structure of a
						sentence with a range of options describable as the “Cline of Metaphoricity” (Halliday and Matthiessen,
						2014). According to Halliday, metaphoricity happens inside a sentence when the actions (i.e. verbs and
						adjectives) are converted into nouns, a process that is known as “nomianlization”. Turning verbs into nouns
						through nominalization can turn a complex clause into a simple one (Halliday and Webster, 2004), a common
						feature of professional and academic English texts (Bhatia, 2014).
					</p>
					<p>
						Developed by <a href="https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/person/dsaberi2">Dariush Saberi</a> in the Halliday
						Centre, the Nominalization and Lexical Formality Application was part of a project entitled Meeting the
						Challenge of Teaching and Learning Language in the University: Enhancing Linguistic Competence and
						Performance in English and Chinese. It represents an endeavour to design an assisted academic English
						writing system that automates the nominalization and lexical substitution in ESL/EFL writings.
					</p>
					<p>
						The contributions of the system include an algorithm for noun generation using a neural language model, a
						model design for an assisted writing system for CALL, mappings for nominalization, and academic lexical
						substitution. Evaluations of the system performance show that it is capable of significant impacts on
						students’ writing.
