					<h2>The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday, Volumes 1-11</h2>
					<h3>Editor: Jonathan J. Webster</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						For nearly half a century Michael Halliday has been enriching the discipline of linguistics with his keen
						insight into the social semiotic phenomenon we call language. Now, for the first time, Halliday's collected
						works are available as an eleven-volume set.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a self-styled 'generalist' Michael Halliday has published in many branches of linguistics, both
						theoretical and applied, including grammar and semantics, discourse analysis and stylistics, phonology,
						sociolinguistics, computational linguistics, language education and child language development. This
						eleven-volume set encompasses all of these aspects of Halliday's work.
