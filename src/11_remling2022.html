					<h1>Conference theme</h1>
					Language as a social phenomenon that mediates and creates meaning has received paramount importance due to its
					direct bearing on societal issues. At the same time, approaches to language have become continuously ever more
					multidisciplinary, reflecting not only the advancements of scientific methods but also the multitude of
					stakeholders, hence perspectives, with vested interest in language. This is especially well evidenced by the
					world-wide focus on the language of healthcare to investigate the role of language and communication in the
					fighting against global pandemics such as COVID-19. The landscape of linguistic studies has been immensely
					broadened and enriched.<br><br>
					The emergent societal requirements have also called for internationally concerted attention to PhD students as
					an important echelon of language professionals under training to meet the challenges. It is timely to present
					insights into the range of contemporaneous topics and associated methodologies that mark the necessity of a
					socially responsive linguistic programme. In this regard, the increasingly important empirical, corpus-based
					perspective has engendered a wealth of methods and approaches to language in combination with some of the more
					qualitative methods focused on theories and epistemologies.
					</p>

					<p id="2">
					<h1>Conference organisers</h1>
					REMLing’22 is jointly organised by the Halliday Centre for Intelligent Applications for Language Studies
					(HCLS) at City University of Hong Kong, the MIIT Centre of AI-based Linguistic Information Processing (CALIP)
					at Beihang University, Beijing, and the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Sciences (CASS) at
					Lancaster University. The even is sponsored by the Beijing-HK University Alliance, Hong Kong.
					<br><br>The three research centres are themselves a manifestation of multifaceted perspectives on language.
					HCLS is fundamentally motivated by the Hallidayan notion of language as a social phenomenon, CALIP is
					affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, and CASS is hallmarked by the
					Economic and Social Research Council of the UK. All three have the common grounding in corpus-based approaches
					to language.
					</p>

					<p id="3">
					<h1>Conference call</h1>
					REMLing’22 is calling for submissions from interested PhD candidates in language-related studies in the three
					organising universities. Papers based on recently submitted theses are equally welcome. Each submission should
					be in the form of long abstracts of up to three single-sided A4 pages in length.
					<br><br>The submissions are expected to describe the topics and research questions and to elaborate on
					associated research methods with discussions and, especially, reflections on the impact of the chosen methods
					on the research outcome. They should present a clear description of the research topic, previous studies
					focused on methodologies, and the chosen approach representing qualitative, quantitative and hybrid methods.
					Selected submissions will be invited to expand the description and to present a convincing case of study,
					through reviews, in-depth discussions and illustrative examples, to engage critically with the research topic
					under study. Submissions are expected to use a clear structure covering introduction, research questions,
					methods, results, and discussions. All submissions should have a covering page indicating title of submission,
					author’s name, and author’s affiliation.
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>CityU submissions should be sent via email to: <span
								style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline">hcls@cityu.edu.hk</span> </li>
						<li>Beihang submission should be sent via email to: <span
								style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline">weiren@buaa.edu.cn</span> </li>
						<li>Lancaster submissions should be sent via email to: <span
								style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline">cass@lancaster.ac.uk</span> </li>
					</ul>

					</p>

					<p id="4">
					<h1>Conference publication</h1>
					Selected papers will be included in a volume of conference proceedings. After the conference, the selected
					papers will be considered for possible publication in a special issue of an academic journal. The conference
					organisers will also aim to identify opportunities to publish the papers as chapters in a dedicated book.
