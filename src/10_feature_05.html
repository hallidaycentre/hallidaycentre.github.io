					<h1> Computation and Quantitative Studies</h1>
					<br>
					<p>
						Expertly edited by Jonathan Webster, this sixth volume in the collected works by Michael Halliday includes
						his writings that span five decades, covering developments in machine translation and corpus linguistics.
						Throughout his career, Michael Halliday continued to address the issue of the application of linguistic
						scholarship to computational and quantitative studies of language. The principles and methods outlined in
						these papers remain as relevant today as when they were first published, continuing to point the way forward
						in an endeavour where success depends more on advancing our knowledge of language than machines. According
						to Jan Svartvik, Emeritus Professor at Lund University, Sweden:
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>This is a deeply impressive book by a prominent linguist. As always, Professor Halliday's contributions
							are pervasively readable and stimulating.</i>
