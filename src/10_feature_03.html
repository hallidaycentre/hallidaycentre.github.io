					<h1> Shell nouns as register-specific discourse devices</h1>

						This article provides a corpus-based investigation into shell nouns. Shell nouns perform a variety of
						referential functions and express speaker stance. The investigation was motivated by the fact that past
						research in this area has been primarily based on written texts. Very little is known about the use of shell
						nouns in speech. The study used the ICE-GB corpus of contemporary British English and investigated
						cataphoric shell nouns complemented by appositive that-clauses across fine-grained spoken and written
						registers. It has revealed that the deployment of shell nouns is governed by the principle of register
						formality definable in terms of contextual configurations of the Field-Tenor-Mode complex rather than the
						mode of production. Additionally, the study has uncovered the frequent use of a small core set of shell
						nouns common across speech and writing. Hence it argues that shell nouns are part and parcel of spoken and
						written discourse and that they pertain more to grammar than to lexis.
