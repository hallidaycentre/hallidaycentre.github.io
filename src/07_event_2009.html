								In their final reflections on &quot;the exhaustiveness of the scientific pursuit&quot; in
								relation to consciousness and the material order, Edelman and Tononi (2000:222) argue that
								not &quot;all meaningful relations at the level of consciousness&quot; are appropriate
								scientific subjects (even though they may be &quot;scientifically founded objects&quot;).
								The instances offered as cases in point include &quot;meaningful sentences in ordinary
								language&quot; and &quot;even better... poetic exchanges&quot; (ibid).<br><br>In this paper
								I set out from the reasons the authors offer for what they see as a &quot;fascinating
								point&quot;. I then offer analyses of grammatical and textual phenomena using specific tools
								of systemic functional theory - first of all, Halliday's account of identifying clauses in
								English; and then Hasan's development (from the 1960s) of &quot;cohesive harmony&quot;. My
								aim in these examples is to demonstrate, in each case, the direct bearing the enquiry has on
								debates concerning higher order consciousness. The two debates which I offer here as test
								cases pertain to:<br><br>

								1) the crucial notion of the &quot;duplex self&quot; (William James 1842-1910): myself as
								observed object (&quot;Me&quot;), and as participatory subject (&quot;I&quot;).<br>
								2) the controversy surrounding &quot;dissociative&quot; states, first systematically
								characterised as a 'disaggregation' or as a 'fragmentation' of consciousness, by Janet
								(1859-1947) and by Hughlings-Jackson (1835-1947).<br><br>

								The emergent purposes of the discussion are, then:<br>
								a) to argue against any claim that we must relinquish a science of &quot;meaningful
								relations&quot; (in the terms cited above);<br>
								b) to demonstrate the realizational relationship between all levels of organization
								of human consciousness (from molecules to meanings in neuroscience viz. Kandel ); and<br>
								c) to bring out the implication of (b), namely, that language does not reflect the
								individual mind - it is the mind at a level which is realized, collectively, in the lattice
								of our specific, intersubjective relationships.

								The theme of the conference will be &quot;Challenges to Systemic Functional Linguistics:
								theory and practice&quot;, focusing on the issues and challenges confronting this school of
								linguistics, both with respect to the development of systemic and functional theory, as well
								as in its application to different languages, fields and contexts. Like the theme of previous
								ISFCs, the theme of this congress is also intended to be broad and inclusive. It may involve
								views on the prospect of the semiotic systems, the construction of the SF semantic schema,
								the relationship between language and society, between language and mind, and between
								language and reality, child language development, language fuzziness, language planning and
								language planning and language policy, language education, discourse analysis, linguistics
								and translation, etc.

								Interacting on a daily basis with colleagues and superiors in the workplace
								poses interesting and subtle discursive challenges for individuals, especially
								those in leadership positions. Through their talk, leaders need to simultaneously
								construct themselves as responsible professionals oriented to the transactional
								goals of the organisation and as caring colleagues, concerned with developing
								and maintaining supportive and positive workplace relationships.<br /><br />
								This talk illustrates how the Wellington Language in the Workplace (LWP) Project
								tracked such discursive accomplishments by female and male leaders in a range of
								different New Zealand organisations, including some with distinctive ethnic
								orientations. The distinctive and innovative approach and methodology of the
								LWP Project will be discussed and illustrated.
