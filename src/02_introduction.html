					<h1>Introduction </h1>
					<p>
						The Halliday Centre for Intelligent Applications of Language Studies (HCLS) bears the name
						of the world-renowned linguist, Professor Michael Halliday. It was officially launched in
						March 2006 in his presence at City University of Hong Kong. The Centre has the distinct honour
						of being named after this distinguished scholar, who for over half a century enriched the
						discipline of linguistics with his keen insight into language. His scholarship has advanced
						our understanding of language as a social phenomenon of meaning, the accurate and contextually
						appropriate processing of which lies right at the core of human communication and computer
						understanding of natural language. The Centre Director is Dr Alex Fang, Department of Linguistics
						and Translation, who succeeded Professor Jonathan Webster, the founding director of the Centre, on 1 July
						2021.
					</p>

					<!--

				<h1>Vision &amp; Mission </h1>
					<p>
					We aim to apply our knowledge about how language works to achieving a better understanding of other
					phenomena in the human experience in order to:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Advance our knowledge of how language works to construe our experience and enact
							social relationships</li>
						<li>Apply linguistic insight in such areas as education, and computer processing of language, i.e.
							practicing applicable linguistics</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The Centre is committed to doing apply-able linguistic research, including corpus linguistics,
						discourse studies, visual analytics for texts, language learning, linguistic studies of Chinese and
						other minority languages, and translation.</p>


				<h1>About Professor M.A.K. Halliday</h1>
                    <p>
                    Professor M.A.K. Hallidayis Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at The University of Sydney and Honourary
                    Professor at the Department of Linguistics and Translation, City University of Hong Kong (CityU). He is
                    currently Advisor to The Halliday Centre for Intelligent Applications of Language Studies (HCLS), CityU.
                    </p>
                    <p>
					As a significant contribution to language studies, Professor Halliday has developed a theoretical approach
					known as "systemic functional linguistics", incorporating a comprehensive model of grammar which has been
					applied to English and numerous other languages including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Thai.
					His emphasis has always been on theory as a resource for solving problems (he calls it an "appliable" theory),
					so that his work has been of interest to a wide audience of those concerned with language, such as educators,
					computer scientists and practitioners in various professional fields.</p>
