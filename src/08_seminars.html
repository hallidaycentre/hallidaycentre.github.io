							<td align="justify"><br>
								<p>In this paper, I want to discuss both the history of ideology as a semiotic phenomenon, and its
									history as a concept in the social sciences.
									In the first part of my talk, I will argue, following Vološinov (1929), that language is always
									ideological, and that, following Halliday (e.g. 2003),
									the ideological efficacy of language is a function of its architecture, ie, of its metafunctional,
									realizational and stratificational complexity.
									These features of language emerge as part of the extended moment in our evolutionary history which can
									be considered the "semiotic big-bang" (Lukin, in press).
									I will also consider the reasons why it has been argued that the modern period has witnessed a rise in
									the proliferation and power of ideology (Malešević 2010, 2017).</p>
								<p>In the second half, I turn to a history of the study of ideology, which turns out to be tied up with
									the history of linguistic relativity. Though this idea is typically associated with
									Whorf and linguistic debates in the 20th century, its lineage goes back to Condillac's Essay on the
									Origin of Human Knowledge, which presents the first coherent account of the sign-mediated nature
									of sensory experience (Aarslef, 1982). From Condillac, Enlightenment philosopher Destutt de Tracy took
									his concept of the study of ideas, for which he coined the term "id&eacute;ologie".
									I conclude with a brief overview of how different linguistic schools approach the study of ideology.

							<td align="justify"><br>
								<p>War emerged as a consequence of the agricultural revolution, as humans settled into farming and
									herding in villages,
									around 5000 years ago (Eckhardt 1992). But war in the modern (ie post-Enlightenment period) has become
									more and more lethal,
									and as such, requires more and more semiotic energy for its legitimation (Malešević 2010). This paper
									examines the lexical item war,
									to show how its centrality to modern society is reflected in its linguistic characteristics. I
									consider the lexical item with respect to its dictionary definition
									and thesaurus location, its absolute and relative frequencies (relative to related concepts, such as
									violence) in both multi- and mono-generic corpora,
									its typical collocations, and some of its colligational affordances (for instance, its preference for
									an intransitive semantics).
									The findings (set out in Lukin, in press) confirm the ideological saturation of lexis (as argued for
									by e.g. Vološinov, Firth, Halliday),
									and the coercive nature of microgrammar. In other words, when speakers “choose” the lexical item war,
									they invite into their discourse a host of semantic tendencies,
									which largely affirm our ongoing commitment to war as a legitimate form of human action, despite the
									evidence of its brutal, inhuman consequences.</p>

								Literary Creativity in World Englishes continues to expand rapidly. Unfortunately the complimenting
								criticism has not kept up enough, much as it is needed. Every literature,
								especially emergent ones, best benefit from the criticism and other exegetical attention generated from

								I will look into some of the issues involved, using my own experience (reflected in the selection of
								poems) starting from the early 50s.
								These issues range from the challenges of creating in what is an adopted - but now main - language, some
								dominant themes, the function of the poet, and other related matters.

									This paper chronicles the history of map-making, showing how the way maps develop is in tandem with the development
									of patterns of group identity and language use. My question is whether ways of conceptualising the
									physical world feed into language ideology, that set of beliefs, values and attitudes drawn from our sociopolitical
									environment, which directs, constrains and moulds our language behaviour. Benedict Anderson (1991)
									noted the parallel development of mapping, identity and language practices in nation building. My argument
									here is that it is also possible to see this association in the medieval world and that there are some indicators
									that such co-occurrence is discernible in map-making, identity formation and language practices in postnational
									settings. As ever in the social sciences it would be inappropriate to claim clear cause and effect. However,
									it is possible to demonstrate that changes in world view co-occur with changes in language behaviour. It
									may, therefore, be legitimate to hypothesise that the view of ourselves that maps give us and the identities we
									assume as part of groups thus constructed play some part in the choice of languages we willingly acquire and
									speak.<br><br>

									<b>Professor Sue Wright</b> has been Professor of Language and Politics at the University of Portsmouth since
									2006 and was Director of the Centre for European and International Studies Research 2008-9. Her slightly unusual
									professorial title stems from her research in language policy from the 1980s onwards. Very early on it became clear
									to her that this has to be interdisciplinary work and that linguists who want to examine subjects such as the role
									of language in nation building, the problems associated with language rights for minority groups and issues of
									communication in globalisation need a clear understanding of the political contexts. Her field work has covered
									minority language issues in the south of France, problems of communication in the European parliament and
									transnational communication on the Internet. Her theoretical work has addressed language issues in local, national,
									supranational and international settings. <br><br>

									Since retiring from full time work in 2011 she has continued to teach courses on language and identity on MA and
									UG courses and mentor research at University of Portsmouth. She spent a semester as visiting professor at the
									University of Jyvaskyla in 2012. <br><br>

									A convergence of factors is creating ever wider access to ever more massive amounts of digital language
									data that can feed the construction of language models. What these machine-readable models are good for,
									however, depends not only on how big they are but on how they are structured as well. Design of the structure
									can affect not simply what sorts of knowledge these models embed but how transparent that knowledge is to
									people who might benefit from it (corpus linguists and lexicographers but also learners and teachers, for example).
									<br><br>

									<img src="events/2014/pics/david_wible_1301-2.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="134" style="float:left; padding: 10px ;">
									In this talk I illustrate some new possibilities that emerge when a novel structure based on some rather old but
									powerful concepts is implemented in a computational language model. The model, called StringNet (nav.stringnet.org),
									incorporates and cross-indexes the syntagmatic and paradigmatic dimensions of relations that words contract with
	 								each other in their distributions attested in corpora. English StringNet is a massive network of over 2 billion
 									multiword patterns connected to each other in a navigable web. I illustrate some of the linguistic phenomena
 									which become susceptible to discovery and investigation under this sort of knowledge structure, particularly its
 									capacity to capture &quot;partially productive lexico-grammatical patterns&quot; (or grammatical constructions)
 									(Kay 1997) that have proven &quot;a pain in the neck&quot; for computational linguists (Sag et al 2002), not to
	 								mention for language learners and teachers. I also show how StringNet instantiates a new sort of thesaurus using
 									the distributional notion of lexical semantics (Harris 1954), which assumes we know the meaning of words largely
 									by the accumulated contexts of their use (Wittgenstein 1953). We show how these contexts are rendered open to
	 								exploration within their network of interrelations, suggesting new possibilities for supporting linguistic
	 								research as well as contextually grounded language learning and teaching. A beta version of Chinese StringNet
 									will be presented briefly as well if time permits.
