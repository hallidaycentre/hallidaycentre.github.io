					<h1>Connected Cartographies: World Maps in Translation between China, Inner Asia and Early Modern Europe</h1>

					<p>Principal Investigator: Florin-Stefan Morar</p>

					<p>
						The relations between China and the West are currently receiving extensive global attention. Yet, the
						history of these relations is much deeper, dating back to the root of modernity. Most notably, this history
						is defined not only by politics and economics, but also by substantial cultural contact and exchange. The
						proposed project will examine some of the earliest cross-cultural exchanges between China and the West with
						a focus on maps, particularly maps of the world. World maps are significant for the history of Sino-Western
						cross-cultural contact, as they were some of the earliest items to be translated across: in Europe atlases
						such as the Guang Yutu 廣輿圖 by Zhu Siben, in various forms, were the source of representations of China for
						much of the early modern period up to the 19th century; in China world maps such as those produced by Matteo
						Ricci were the first cartographic works representing distant lands beyond Asia, introducing terminologies of
						world geography that are still in use today. The project will argue that these two processes of translation
						are inter-connected and represent two aspects of one phenomenon of hybridization of divergent Eurasian
						vocabularies and techniques of cartography. Using new methodologies from global history, translation
						studies, and the history of science, the project will position translation as a key means by which to
						understand the long history of cross-cultural contact. To accomplish its aim, the project proposes to
						sequentially trace case studies of cartographic translation from the first instances of globalization in the
						sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. The proposed research will have manifold implications in terms of
						understanding mutual representations of China and the West. Project outcomes will include both a book-length
						monograph for publication by a major North American or UK university press and a website with enhanced data
						on key cartographic materials.
