							<td align="justify"><br>
								A convergence of factors is creating ever wider access to ever more massive amounts of digital language
								data that can feed the construction of language models. What these machine-readable models are good for,
								however, depends not only on how big they are but on how they are structured as well. Design of the
								structure
								can affect not simply what sorts of knowledge these models embed but how transparent that knowledge is
								to
								people who might benefit from it (corpus linguists and lexicographers but also learners and teachers,
								for example).

								In this talk I illustrate some new possibilities that emerge when a novel structure based on some rather
								old but
								powerful concepts is implemented in a computational language model. The model, called StringNet
								(nav.stringnet.org),
								incorporates and cross-indexes the syntagmatic and paradigmatic dimensions of relations that words
								contract with
								each other in their distributions attested in corpora. English StringNet is a massive network of over 2
								billion
								multiword patterns connected to each other in a navigable web. I illustrate some of the linguistic
								phenomena
								which become susceptible to discovery and investigation under this sort of knowledge structure,
								particularly its
								capacity to capture &quot;partially productive lexico-grammatical patterns&quot; (or grammatical
								constructions)
								(Kay 1997) that have proven &quot;a pain in the neck&quot; for computational linguists (Sag et al 2002),
								not to
								mention for language learners and teachers. I also show how StringNet instantiates a new sort of
								thesaurus using
								the distributional notion of lexical semantics (Harris 1954), which assumes we know the meaning of words
								largely
								by the accumulated contexts of their use (Wittgenstein 1953). We show how these contexts are rendered
								open to
								exploration within their network of interrelations, suggesting new possibilities for supporting
								linguistic
								research as well as contextually grounded language learning and teaching. A beta version of Chinese
								StringNet
								will be presented briefly as well if time permits.

								This paper chronicles the history of map-making, showing how the way maps develop is in tandem with the
								development
								of patterns of group identity and language use. My question is whether ways of conceptualising the
								physical world feed into language ideology, that set of beliefs, values and attitudes drawn from our
								sociopolitical
								environment, which directs, constrains and moulds our language behaviour. Benedict Anderson (1991)
								noted the parallel development of mapping, identity and language practices in nation building. My
								argument
								here is that it is also possible to see this association in the medieval world and that there are some
								indicators
								that such co-occurrence is discernible in map-making, identity formation and language practices in
								postnational
								settings. As ever in the social sciences it would be inappropriate to claim clear cause and effect.
								However,
								it is possible to demonstrate that changes in world view co-occur with changes in language behaviour. It
								may, therefore, be legitimate to hypothesise that the view of ourselves that maps give us and the
								identities we
								assume as part of groups thus constructed play some part in the choice of languages we willingly acquire
								and
								speak.<br><br>

								<b>Professor Sue Wright</b> has been Professor of Language and Politics at the University of Portsmouth
								since
								2006 and was Director of the Centre for European and International Studies Research 2008-9. Her slightly
								unusual
								professorial title stems from her research in language policy from the 1980s onwards. Very early on it
								became clear
								to her that this has to be interdisciplinary work and that linguists who want to examine subjects such
								as the role
								of language in nation building, the problems associated with language rights for minority groups and
								issues of
								communication in globalisation need a clear understanding of the political contexts. Her field work has
								covered
								minority language issues in the south of France, problems of communication in the European parliament
								and
								transnational communication on the Internet. Her theoretical work has addressed language issues in
								local, national,
								supranational and international settings. <br><br>

								Since retiring from full time work in 2011 she has continued to teach courses on language and identity
								on MA and
								UG courses and mentor research at University of Portsmouth. She spent a semester as visiting professor
								at the
								University of Jyvaskyla in 2012. <br><br>

								The International Conference on Translation Education, with its 2014 theme of Computer-Aided
								Teaching of Translation: Theory, Practice and New Technologies, provides a unique forum for observing
								this paradigm development in language and translation pedagogy and reflecting on its rationale,
								applicability
								and feasibility, among other concerns. It will bring together translation educators and practitioners,
								language experts, language programme designers, software developers, publishers and translation and
								education service providers for a 2-day discussion about 1) the significance of computer-aided,
								corpus-based modes of teaching for translation studies and translation pedagogy; 2) relations between
								design,
								construction and implementation of computer-aided teaching programmes and their pedagogical efficiency
								in both classroom and online teaching of translation and interpreting; and 3) new trends in the
								development
								of computer-aided, corpus-supported approaches to translation studies and
								translator/interpreter-training.
								Apart from a range of parallel sessions, the Conference will include a special session of hands-on
								technology
								workshop on computer-aided online teaching of English and Chinese translation.<br><br>

								The Journal of World Languages explores the linguistic, communicative and socio-cultural implications
								of the global spread of major languages and the impact this is having on the world's linguistic mapping.
								Recognizing that the phenomenon of becoming a world language encompasses a growing number of languages
								with significant implications for the development of these languages, the Journal of World Languages
								encourages a comparative approach to the study of the roles of education, the media, the economy, etc.
								in contributing to the growth of a world language. It is a cross-disciplinary journal whose coverage
								of the effects of globalization on languages extends coverage to all world languages.<br><br>
